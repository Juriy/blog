Bezier curves play a very important role in game development. The obvious implementation - drawing smooth shapes on your Canvas is only the top of the iceberg, a small piece of what you can do. In this post we will explore Bezier curves and build few JavaScript applications that uncover the true power and beauty of this simple mathematical concept. 

- What are Bezier curves and why they are used so widely
- Math behind them: how to build a curve
- Connecting multiple curves into a single smooth path
- Making animation follow the path
- Bezier Curves as custom easing functions
- Random Curves, Moppi Flower in JS (bonus)
