Today I descovered a very interesting platform and I instantly fell in love with it. It is <a href="http://livecoding.tv">http://livecoding.tv</a>. In simple words, this is Twitch for coders. The idea is great! So if you want to live-code together some day, subscribe to my <a href="http://livecoding.tv/juriy">channel</a>!

People stream their work process, commenting as they code. What makes it better than the other streaming services is the clear targeting on code, social and discovery features. Once I marked my channel as “HTML5 GameDev” and started to stream I had first developers joining the broadcast in just few minutes. <!-- Read more -->

There’s still much to improve on the platform though. The biggest downside for me is the connection speed. I had to drop the bitrate to mere 700 kbps to avoid breaks in broadcast. Watching other channels was a bit painful too: I saw “buffering”  screen way too frequently.

Overall, I think the service will have a bright future. 

For the next few weeks I will be broadcasting several sessions on JS and GameDev. <a href="http://livecoding.tv/juriy">Follow me on Livecoding</a>!
