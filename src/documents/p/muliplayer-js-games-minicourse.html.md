I started a new video mini-course "Multiplayer JS Games". So far there are 4 lessons (more than an hour of video) released on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrEyydzMmC6CnC-DqbkFn5btBnqhxbaEj">YouTube channel</a>. The course  shows how to create a multiplayer game from a scratch **and** learn EcmaScript-2015 syntax in practice. Check it out! 

Lesson 1: Client-server handshake
---------------------------------
Learn how to set up project and build a socket-io / io.js 'Hello World' application.

Lesson 4: Win conditions
---------------------------------
(not published yet)The game is all about winning or losing. Let's implement the end-game check and tell the results to the players


Lesson 5: Tidying up
---------------------------------
(not yet released)
Let's make our code a bit friendlier and UI a bit nicer.

Lesson 6: Handling disconnects
-------------------------------------------
(not yet released)
If your opponent disconnects you wouldn't want to wait for his turn forever. Implement disconnect handling.

Lesson 7: Logging in
-------------------------------------------
(not yet released)
All users are guests, wouldn't it be nice to give them the real names? We're introducing authentication through HTML form in this lesson.

Lesson 8: Leaving localhost
-------------------------------------------
(not yet released)
The game is ready for sharing with friends, but that will be hard to do on localhost. In this video we'll show how to deploy your game to AWS.

Lesson 9: Facebook
-------------------------------------------
(not yet released)
Learn how to deploy your game to Facebook!

Lesson 10: Mobile devices
-------------------------------------------
(not yet released)
Learn how to use PhoneGap (aka Apache Cordova) to deploy your game to iOS and Android.
