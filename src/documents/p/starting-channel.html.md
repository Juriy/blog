Last few months I was experimenting a lot with video tutorials and webinars. Started as a hobby, ended up as a mini-studio. I tried various formats and recorded two Udemy courses on JavaScript and Grunt.js, and that's just a start. 

Today I've started a separate YouTube stream to share my tutorials. This time it is my favorite subject - Game Development with JavaScript. Unlike the book, the tutorial series puts a strong focus on multiplayer. With the development of Node.js and NoSQL databases that allow to scale your platform so easily - multiplayer game dev becomes so much easier!

Video posting has a huge potential, with its limitations of course. For example, I still don't like to read the code from streaming video. Everybody reads at his own pace: for some the code might be obvious and others will need to spend more time getting through the lines. <!-- Read more --> 

I found that **the best** kind of *remote* learning (because nothing can beat working together at the same desk and sharing the same white board) will be videos + github + small e-book guides if you have to refresh the knowledge.

Right now we are preparing for a big 25-hours course on multiplayer game dev that will combine all our experience in web graphics and animation, networking, design of distributed systems, cloud deployments and of course building game mechanics.
