My name is Juriy Bura – I do JavaScript, HTML5 as well as some old-school enterprizy Java software. 

I’m a passionate game developer and I in my opinion making games is at least as much fun as playing them. And for sure gamedev takes the first position in my personal “happiness per line of code” chart. If you never tried to write your own game before – just do it and believe me you will open a whole new world.

I wrote a book about gamedev, “Pro Android Web Game Apps” that was published by Apress in late 2012. It is not really limited to Android, it is more about HTML5 gamedev in general, but having 600+ pages I just couldn’t put few more chapters about differences in browsers, and other platforms like iOS or Win. Maybe the next one will cover it.

My other passion is teaching. There's nothing more rewarding than a student who says "_now_ I understand how it really works". Taking a concept that looks hard and breaking it down to a harmonical system of simple parts is a real challenge. You can only do it if you perfectly unerstand it yourself. And then, the second challenge is to present those concepts right: with code, words, diagrams or whatever makes learners grasp that material. 

I tend to travel a lot and live and work in different places. During last three years I lived in Zurich, Kiev and Hong Kong and that's where I am now. I like hacking JavaScript, longboarding or just enjoying the life around me.
