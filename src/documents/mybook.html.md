Pro Android Web Game Apps is a book about making web games. Not only for Android but for every modern web browser. The world is moving crazy fast, and many things have changed since late 2012 when the book was published. However the core game techniques have not changed: user input, drawing sprites, animations, rendering tile maps, 3D graphics - all these have not changed at all. 

If you’ve read the book or reading it right now – I would really appreciate a word from you – share your thoughts about what’s good or bad about it. I appreciate your opinion!
