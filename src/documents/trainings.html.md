Webinars
--------

Webinars combine the convenience of online classroom with the 
personalized attention to each student. We can customize the content 
of sessions to match the needs of a group. 

After the session, students get further support on forums. We'll make
sure to answer all your questions. As an additional bonus, each student
gets 30-50% discount on selected videocourses.

Video Courses
--------

Each video course is a result of a production experience. We carefully 
ballanced the fundamental theory with practice to build a deep 
understanding of each technology. You can start applying new skills 
straight away while exploring more advanced subjects. We are committed to
give you the knowledge and give it in the best possible way.

For us, quality matters a lot. Our content is 
recorded with professional studio equipment and optimized for 
viewing on smaller screens. You can study on the go - code, drawings 
and diagrams are easy to read with most mobile devices.
