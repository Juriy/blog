Git Bootcamp
--------

This webinar is for those who sometimes feels lost with git. Even if you worked with Git before, and you find yourself in a situation when "I have no clue what is going on with my repository" or "I think I better don't do that, 'cause I don't know what will happen", then this course is for you.
